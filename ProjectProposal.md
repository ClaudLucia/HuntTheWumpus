## Project Description
For the final project, we would like to create the 2-player client/server "Hunt the Wumpus" game. This game will be turn-based and for each turn, the user or the Wumpus is allowed to move to one of the 3 adjacent rooms or stay (?). The Player must kill the Wumpus with its arrow before the Wumpus finds it. There can be bats in the rooms, in which will carry the Player to a random room if encountered, or there can be a bottomless pit in the rooms, in which the Player dies if encounters. The bats and pits have no affect on the Wumpus and it can stay in the same room as them (?) (or should we make the bats move if the Wumpus comes?)
The Player will have the following senses as described in the original game:
1. Smell, Player can smell the Wumpus that is one room away (but don't know which)
2. Hear, Player can hear the bats that is one room away (but don't know which)
3. Feel, Player can feel the cool breeze from the bottomless pit that is one room away (but don't know which)
The Wumpus will have the following sense:
1. Smell, Wumpus can smell the human flesh that is one room away (know or don't know which?)
(?) - more?
To win the game, the Player must kill the Wumpus with its crooked arrow that can travel a path of 1-5 rooms or the Wumpus must find the Player before getting killed.
